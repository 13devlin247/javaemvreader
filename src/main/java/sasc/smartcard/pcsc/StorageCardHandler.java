/**
 * Handler for reading storage cards inserted into a PC/SC compatible reader
 * (That is, a supported card AND a supported reader is required)
 * 
 * Commands are sent to the IFD (reader), and then translated to appropriate commands for the respective cards.
 * Some commands only return data from the readers memory (like Get UID/HB)
 * 
 * Some readers (e.g. ACR) have their own API for communication with storage cards.
 * This handler only supports readers that comply with the PC/SC spec
 * 
 * Class is 0xff
 * 
 * Part 3. Requirements for PC-Connected Interface Devices pcsc3_v2.01.09.pdf
 * 3.2.2.1 Storage Card Functionality Support
 * 
 * This handler is invoked by locating the special access data in ATR
 * Example of how a PC/SC compliant IFD announces that it translates communication to a memory card
 * Samsung Galaxy S3 Secure Element:
 * 4F = AID (or possibly just RID of authority for the data??)
 * 0C = Length of AID
 * A0 00 00 03 06 = RID of PC/SC
 * 00 = No information given
 * 00 00 = Name (registered ID in PC/SC doc)
 * 00 00 00 00 = RFU
 * http://smartcard-atr.appspot.com/parse?ATR=3b8f8001804f0ca0000003060000000000000068
